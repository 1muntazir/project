      <p> The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England.International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877.</p>
      <li>

      <p> Internationally, cricket is governed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"></a><abbr title=" International_Cricket_Council">(ICC),</abbr> which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership, although only twelve currently play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket">Test cricket</a>.</p>
      <li>

      <p> It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowls">bowls</a> is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket_gate">wicket gate</a> as the a wicket.</p>
      <li>

      <p> The first ever international cricket game was between the <a href="https://chase-your-sport-images.s3.amazonaws.com/blogImage/880x600/1697479122115-57071.webp">US and Canada in 1844.</a>The match was played at the grounds of the <a href="https:///OI77">St George's Cricket Club in New York.</a></p>
      <li>

      <p> During most of the 19th-century standard overs were made up of four deliveries. In 1889 five-ball overs were introduced in first-class cricket, with a move to generally use six-ball overs in 1900.</p>

          Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image of cricket pitch and creases) between two teams of eleven players each.[72] The field is usually circular or oval in shape, and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line, or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.
